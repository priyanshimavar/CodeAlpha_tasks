# CodeAlpha Python Internship Tasks

This repository contains the Python projects completed as part of the CodeAlpha internship program.
Each script focuses on building practical Python skills through small, self‑contained applications. 

## Projects in this Repository

- `CodeAlpha_BasicChatbot.py`  
  A simple rule‑based chatbot that interacts with the user through the terminal.
  It responds to common inputs using predefined patterns and demonstrates basic input handling and conditional logic. 

- `CodeAlpha_HangmanGame.py`  
  A classic Hangman word‑guessing game played in the console.
  The user tries to guess the hidden word letter by letter within a limited number of attempts. 

- `CodeAlpha_StockPortfolioTracker.py`  
  A Python script to track a simple stock portfolio.
  It allows adding holdings, updating prices or quantities, and viewing the total portfolio value in a structured way. 

- `CodeAlpha_TaskAutomationUsingPythonScript.py`  
  A task automation script that performs routine operations (such as handling files, simple data processing, or repetitive actions) to demonstrate how Python can be used to automate daily tasks. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system  
- Any extra libraries used inside individual scripts (for example, `requests`, `datetime`, etc.) 

## How to Run

Clone this repository:

Use `python3` instead of `python` if your system requires it. [file:1][web:20]

## About the Internship

These mini‑projects were developed during the CodeAlpha internship to practice real‑world Python applications including games, automation, and basic user interaction workflows.
